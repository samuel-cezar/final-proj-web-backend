## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Before Presenting:

1. **Test all CRUD operations**
   - Create, read, update, delete students
   - Create, read, update, delete courses
   - Enroll and unenroll students

2. **Test access control**
   - Login as admin (full access)
   - Login as user (read-only)
   - Try accessing admin pages as regular user

3. **Test responsiveness**
   - Open on mobile/tablet
   - Resize browser window
   - Check all views

4. **Test API endpoints**
   - Use Postman to test `/api/*` routes
   - Verify they still work

---

## 💡 Presentation Tips

1. **Start with login page** - Show the modern design
2. **Demonstrate CRUD** - Create a student and course
3. **Show relationship management** - Enroll student in course
4. **Navigate to matriculas** - Show the overview
5. **Check logs** - Show the auto-refresh
6. **Switch to regular user** - Demonstrate access control
7. **Show mobile view** - Resize browser or use dev tools
8. **Show API still works** - Quick Postman demo

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Password Security**: Passwords stored in plain text (use bcrypt in production)
2. **Session Persistence**: Sessions stored in memory (use Redis in production)
3. **File Uploads**: Structure ready but not implemented
4. **Email Validation**: Basic client-side only
5. **Date Formatting**: Using browser locale, could be standardized

---
